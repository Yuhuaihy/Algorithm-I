Data structure.
・Integer array id[] of length N.
・Interpretation: p and q are connected iff they have the same id.

     0123456789
id[]:0118800188
id[0] = id[5] = id[6]

Find. 
Check if p and q have the same id.
id[6] = 0;id[1] = 1 6 and 1 are not connected

Union. 
To merge components containing p and q, change all entries whose id equals id[p] to id[q].
so if union 1,6
need change 1,2,7
