Weighted quick-union.
・Modify quick-union to avoid tall trees.
・Keep track of size of each tree (number of objects). 
・Balance by linking root of smaller tree to root of larger tree.



Running time.
・Find: takes time proportional to depth of p and q.
・Union: takes constant time, given roots.
lg = base-2 logarithm
 Proposition. Depth of any node x is at most lg N.
 if N = 10, depth= 3
 if N = 1000+, depth ~ 10
 if N = million, depth~20
 if N = billion, depth~30
